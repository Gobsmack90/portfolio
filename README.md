# Harrison King's Portfolio
### Live at https://harrisonking.dev

## This portfolio is built off this one made by Tim Baker
https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template

## My Changes and Additions
- Created new functionality in the portfolio section. clicking on a project now opens an expanded view of the project with a larger image, detailed description and links to the site and github.
- Added a backend that makes the contact form and resume downloads functional. Removed non-functional twitter feed section.
- Added React-router-dom for better routing between the main portfolio and any pages added to my site.
- Added React21 and corresponding files, it is a blackjack app I built in react.
- Changed some of the aesthetics, like the landing image and highlight color.
